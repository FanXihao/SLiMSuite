### Instructions for use

1. Load SNPFreq Data by pressing **Load Data**. The multiload function of SNPFreqR expects the `sgd.R64.2.1.Feature.tdt` and `allfreq.*.snpfreq.tdt` files to be present in a single directory, which can be set in **Adv. Settings**. Alternatively, uncheck the **Load Multiple SNPFreq tables** box to select a single timepoint and feature table.

2. Once data is loaded, check the **Show plot/filters (toggle with Load options)** box. This will open up some more filter/zoom options.

3. Select the data to be plotted and press the **Plot data (Plot tab)** button. Click on the **Plot** tab to generate the plot.

4. Individual SNPs and their frequencies can be examined in tabular form in the **SNP Frequencies** tab. This will (optionally) respond to filter and zoom options.
